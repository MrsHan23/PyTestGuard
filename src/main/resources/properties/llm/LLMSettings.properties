userPrompt=Create unit tests for the Python method "$METHOD_NAME" provided based on the given information using $TEST_FRAMEWORK.\n\n\
To achieve this, you must follow the following steps:\n\
1) Analyze the provided method carefully to understand its functionality\n\
2) Identify edge cases, such as boundary values and failure scenarios, and include them in the test suite\n\
3) Check the provided imports and ensure they are correctly used in the unit tests\n\
4) Ensure the method signatures are correctly followed\n\
